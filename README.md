# soft_collections

A new personal Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. This is a personal project, born out of the need to see improvements in a software I use every day during my work shifts. Currently, I would like it to be considered to enhance the functionality of said software.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
